## Geography

I live in the city of Campinas, in the state of São Paulo, in Brazil.

## Reading

Three of my favourite books are:

- *Game of Thrones* by G. R. R. Martin
- *The Shadow of the wind* by Carlos Ruiz Zafon 
- *Capitães da Areia* by Jorge Amado

## Food

Last night I dreamt about eating in these restaurants:

1. Udon in Belo Horizonte.
2. Loch Fyne in London.
3. Taste Vin in Paris.

## Contact

The best way to get in touch with me is by ringing me.
